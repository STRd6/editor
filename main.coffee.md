Editor
======

The funny story about this editor is that it has an unbroken history from a
single gist https://gist.github.com/STRd6/6286182/6196ffb39db7d10c56aa263190525318ca609db7

The original gist was an exploration in a self-hosting gist editor. One that
could load gists via the Github API, update them, and create new gists. It
succeeded at that, but I ran into the limits of the gist structure, namely no
branches or folders.

I went on and created a git repo, merged in the gist history, and continued from
there. Maybe if I were smarter I could have rewritten it from scratch to be better,
but I had no idea what I was doing and still don't know to this day.

So that may explain why this is in such need of a cleanup.

- Build dependencies into published script
- Dependencies shouldn't be in source
- Dependency metadata should appear in publish script

Gistquire promises refactor

Repository Object to encapsulate repo/branch and make creating/loading trees and issues easier

Compile Error file and line number in error messages

Saving UTF8 Characters gets messed up

Delete Files

Auth redirects to /tempest rather than /editor

Combine commit/publish step

- other branches should publish to <branch>.html
- Published branch is always latest

Don't pass directories to filetree

Saving repos with folders

Load file data better
- Handle folders in repos

Handle file types per extension

Save back to repo from gh-pages demo build

Use editor repo as the default rather than the gist
- Boot from built gh-pages html files.

Deploy a packaged app to gh-pages
- html page named for branch/sha and with source included

Load from actual git repos
Save changes back to real git repos

Visualize Rate Limit Remaining

Make errors like notices
Display Auth Scopes
Do not compile build.js if no js files

Move Gistquire to editor

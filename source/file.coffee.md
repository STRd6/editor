The `File` model represents a file in a file system. It is populated by data
returned from the Github API.

    File = (I={}) ->
      I.path ?= I.filename
      I.filename ?= I.path.split("/").last()
    
      self = Model(I).observeAll()
    
      self.extend
      
The extension is the last part of the filename after the `.`, for example
`"coffee"` for a file named `"main.coffee"` or `"haml"` for a file named
`"filetree.haml"`.
      
        extension: ->
          self.filename().extension()

The `mode` of the file is what editor mode to use for our text editor.

        mode: ->
          switch extension = self.extension()
            when "js"
              "javascript"
            when "md" # TODO: See about nested markdown code modes for .haml.md, .js.md, and .coffee.md
              "markdown"
            when "cson"
              "coffee"
            when ""
              "text"
            else
              extension

Modified tracks whether the file has been changed since it was created.

        modified: Observable(false)

The `displayName` is how the file appears in views.

        displayName: Observable(self.path())

When our content changes we assume we are modified. In the future we may want to
track the original content and compare with that to get a more accurate modified
status.

      self.content.observe ->
        self.modified(true)

When our modified state changes we adjust the file name to provide a visual
indication.

      self.modified.observe (modified) ->
        if modified
          self.displayName("*#{self.path()}")
        else
          self.displayName(self.path())
    
      return self
